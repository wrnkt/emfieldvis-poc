								<p>Leading research on the effects of electromagnetic fields, although not comprehensive, suggests that exposure may lead to negative health outcomes. Research suggests that cell phone EMF in the range of ~ 900MHz may cause significant change in the expression of genes, the functioning of the blood-brain barrier, and the gestation/sex of fetuses (in studies of Syrian hamsters). Other research suggests that human endothelial cells have decreased proliferation rates and survivability even under the influence of low-frequency EMF (1 - 5,000 Hz). Observed physiological effects of EMF exposure on humans include insomnia, headache, depression, fatigue, lowered fertility, poor concentration, affected memory, dizziness, irritability, anxiety, nausea, and strange sensations in the skin such as burning and tingling. Such phenomena have likely become more prevalent among the human population due to the massive increase in the use of electronics over the past hundred years. The World Health Organization has stated that electromagnetic fields are possibly carcinogenic, and there is evidence to suggest cancer rates are higher with greater cell phone usage. One major issue with the dangers of EMF is the lack of public awareness. The modern human environment is riddled with EMF, RF, and IF radiation, and even the World Health Organization has deemed EMF to be a potential environmental hazard; despite this fact much of the unassuming public pays little to no attention to the fields that they are exposed to on a daily basis. There are currently little to no inexpensive, widely-available technologies that negate the electromagnetic fields that are created by the various devices in our homes and offices, however people are able to maintain distance from these fields and this EMF mapping web tool will allow users to do so. This web tool will allow users to create an intuitive, accurate model of the EMF within their homes and/or buildings using the userâ€™s input of their devices. The fields will still exist in varying intensity, however the user will be more aware of the respective safe zones and danger zones within the living space.
